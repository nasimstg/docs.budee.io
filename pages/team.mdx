# Team Management in Budee.io

Budee.io uses Clerk's Organization feature to manage teams. A team consists of admins and members, each with different levels of access and capabilities.

## Admin Role

An admin has full control over the team's settings and members. Here are the key tasks an admin can perform:

1. **Manage the Organization Profile**: Admins can update the organization's information, including its name, logo, and description.

2. **Invite Members**: Admins can invite new members to join the team by sending them an invitation via email.

## Member Role

A member has limited access compared to an admin. Members can view data but cannot make API calls. Here's what a member can do:

1. **View Data**: Members can view all the data available to the team, including campaign performance, budget usage, and more.

Please note that a member is a free account under the organization. They do not have the ability to make changes to the team or its settings.
